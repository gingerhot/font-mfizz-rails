# font-mfizz-rails: A Ruby Gem for Font Mfizz

[Font Mfizz](http://fizzed.com/oss/font-mfizz) provides scalable vector icons representing programming languages, operating systems, software engineering, and technology. It was designed as an extension to [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), it is an iconic font designed for technology and software geeks. It can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.

This gem is inspired by [font-awesome-rails](https://github.com/bokmann/font-awesome-rails).

The font's source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/fizzed/font-mfizz)

Congrats! You now have a set of vector icons for technology and softwares like a real Geek. Pick an icon and check out the
[FontMfizz Usages and Examples](http://fizzed.com/oss/font-mfizz).

### Basic example

A Ruby on Rails icon ([details](http://fizzed.com/oss/font-mfizz/icon-ruby-on-rails-alt)) :

```css
<i class="icon-ruby-on-rails-alt"></i> I love Rails
```

### Helpers

Just one helper available now and I think maybe it's enough for the Font Mfizz:

```ruby
<%= fm_icon "icon-ruby-on-rails-alt" "I love Rails" %>
```

will generate:

```css
<i class="icon-ruby-on-rails-alt"></i> I love Rails
```

here the second parameter is optional.

And you can set an array of style classes as the first parameter:

```ruby
<%= fm_icon ["icon-ruby-on-rails-alt", "font-size-style"] "I love Rails" %>
```

will generate:

```css
<i class="icon-ruby-on-rails-alt font-size-style"></i> I love Rails
```
